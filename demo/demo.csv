70,responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for
71,the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
72,We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
73,basis for our opinion.
74,We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory
75,Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities
76,(“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
77,"financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in"

92,Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
93,Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair
94,"view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a"
95,system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets
96,are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly
97,authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair
98,financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
99,"In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s"
100,"ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern"
101,and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate
102,"the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so."
103,The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
104,Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
105,Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
106,"whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an"
107,"auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but"
108,is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material
109,misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
110,"material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the"
111,economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
112,"As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain"
113,professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
114,"Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether"
115,"due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and"
116,obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
117,risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
118,"resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,"
119,"misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
120,Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
121,"procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing"
122,an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
123,Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
124,accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
125,Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
126,"accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists"
127,related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
128,"continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required"
129,to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
130,"or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on"
131,"the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or"
132,conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.5

315,Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to
316,"be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that"
317,have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
318,Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax

325,balance sheet date.
326,"Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or expenses in profit or loss,"

343,Investment in subsidiary
344,A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by another entity.
345,Control is achieved when the company:
346,Has power over the investee;
347,"Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the"
348,Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
349,The company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances
350,indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed
351,Investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less any impairment in net recoverable value
352,that has been recognised in profit or loss.
353,Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined
354,using the weighted average method. The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress
355,"comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production"
356,overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net
357,"realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the"
358,estimated costs of completion and applicable variable selling expenses.
359,Equipment are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
360,impairment losses.
361,All items of equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequently carried
362,at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
363,Components of costs
364,The cost of an item equipment initially recognised includes its purchase price and
365,any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
366,condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
367,management. Cost also includes borrowing costs and any fair value gains or
368,losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of equipment that are transferred from the
369,hedging reserve.
370,Subsequent expenditure
371,Subsequent expenditure relating to equipment that has already been recognised
372,is added to the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future
373,economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost
374,of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenses
375,are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.T S GLOBAL PROCUREMENT COMPANY PTE. LTD.

396,of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

405,Impairment of non-financial assets
406,Equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is any objective evidence or
407,indication that these assets may be impaired.
408,"For the purpose of impairment testing of assets, recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of"
409,the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset
410,basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those
411,"from other assets. If this is the case, the  recoverable amount is determined for the cash-"
412,generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
413,If the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying
414,"amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount."
415,If the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating units (CGU) is estimated to be
416,"less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its"
417,recoverable amount.
418,The difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount is recognised as an
419,impairment loss in profit or loss.
420,"An impairment loss for an asset is reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the"
421,estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment
422,loss was recognised. The carrying amount of this asset is increased to its revised
423,"recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that"

441,recognises an allowance for impairment when such evidence exists. Significant
442,"financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy"

463,The accounting for financial assets from 1 April 2018 under FRS 109 are as
464,follows: (continued)
465,At initial recognition
466,"At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair"
467,"value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit"
468,"or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition"
469,of the financial assets. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair
470,value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
471,At subsequent measurement
472,Debt instruments of the Company mainly comprise of cash and  bank
473,"deposits, trade and other receivables and loan receivables."
474,"There are three prescribed subsequent measurement categories,"
475,depending on the Company’s business model in managing the assets and
476,the cash flow characteristic of the assets. The Company manages these
477,group of financial assets by collecting the contractual cash flow and these
478,cash flows represents solely payment of principal and interest.
479,"Accordingly, these group of financial assets are measured at amortised"
480,cost subsequent to initial recognition.
481,A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at
482,amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in
483,profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income
484,from these financial assets are recognised using the effective interest rate
485,The Company assesses on forward looking basis the expected credit
486,losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost.
487,For trade receivables (excluding trade receivables due from ultimate
488,"holding company and related companies), the Company applied the"
489,"simplified approach permitted by the FRS 109, which requires expected"
490,lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
491,For trade receivables due from ultimate holding company and related
492,"companies, loan receivables, other receivables and cash and bank"
493,"deposits, the general 3-stage approach is applied. Credit loss allowance"
494,is based on 12-month expected credit loss if there is no significant
495,increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the assets. If there is a
496,"significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, lifetime"
497,expected credit loss will be calculated and recognised.T S GLOBAL PROCUREMENT COMPANY PTE. LTD.

501,Derivative financial instruments
502,The company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to
503,in foreign exchange rate risk. Further details are disclosed in Note 11 to the financial
504,statements. A derivative financial instruments for which no hedge accounting is applied
505,is initially recognised at its fair value on the date the contract is entered into and is
506,subsequently carried at its fair value. Changes in its fair value are recognised in profit or
507,loss. The Company does not apply hedge accounting for its derivative financial
508,instruments. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if
509,the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected
510,to be realised or settled within 12 months.
511,Trade and other payables
512,Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the
513,Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. They are classified as current
514,liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of
515,"the business, if longer). Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities."
516,"Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently carried"
517,at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
518,Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional
519,"right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date, in which"
520,case they are presented as non-current liabilities.
521,Borrowings are initially recognised at fair values (net of transaction costs) and
522,subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of
523,transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period
524,of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
525,2.16    Provisions

530,risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using
531,"the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the"
532,present value of those cash flows.
533,When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to

540,2.17   Fair value estimation of financial assets and financial liabilities
541,The fair values of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as exchange-traded
542,and over-the-counter securities and derivatives) are based on quoted market prices at
543,the balance sheet date. The quoted market prices used for financial assets are the current
544,bid prices; the appropriate quoted market prices used for financial liabilities are the
545,current asking prices.
546,The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are
547,determined by using valuation techniques. The Company uses a variety of methods and
548,makes assumptions based on market conditions that are existing at each balance sheet
549,"date. Where appropriate, quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments"
550,"are used. Valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are also used to"
551,determine the fair values of the financial instruments.
552,The fair values of currency forwards are determined using actively quoted forward
553,exchange rates. The fair values of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value
554,of the estimated future cash flows discounted at actively quoted interest rates.
555,The fair values of current financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost
556,approximate their carrying amounts.
557,Offsetting financial instruments
558,Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet
559,when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle on a
560,net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
561,Cash and cash equivalents
562,"For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents"
563,"include cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions which are subject to an"
564,insignificant risk of change in value.
565,Currency translation
566,"The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“US$’’), which is the"
567,functional currency of the Company.
568,Transactions in a currency other than United States Dollar (“foreign currency”) are
569,translated into United States Dollar using the exchange rates at the dates of the
570,transactions. Currency exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such
571,transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
572,foreign currencies at the closing rates at the balance sheet date are recognised in profit
573,or loss. Non-monetary items measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated
574,using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined.

906,Interest rate risk
907,Interest rate risk arises from the potential change in interest rates that may
908,have an adverse effect on the Company in the current and future years.
909,The Company’s exposure to fluctuation in interest rates is limited to the
910,floating rate loan receivables (Note 13).
911,Interest rate sensitivity
912,The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure
913,to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting
914,period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial
915,year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of
916,instruments that have floating rates. A 50 basis point increase or decrease is
917,used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management
918,personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably
919,possible change in interest rates.
920,If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were
921,"held constant, the company’s profit for the year ended 31 March 2020 would"
922,"increase by US$1,894,000 (2019: US$2,898,000) respectively. This is mainly"
